 * For example, in a game with zero piece previews and hold enabled, the bot will never be able

 * to hold. Another example: in a game with zero piece previews and hold disabled, the bot
 * will only be able to provide a move after the current piece spawns and you provide the piece
 * information to the bot using `cc_add_next_piece_async`.
 * 
 * It is recommended that you call this function the frame before the piece spawns so that the
 * bot has time to finish its current thinking cycle and supply the move.
 * 
 * Once a move is chosen, the bot will update its internal state to the result of the piece
 * being placed correctly and the move will become available by calling `cc_poll_next_move`.

 * 
 * If `plan` and `plan_length` are not `NULL` and this function provides a move, a placement plan
 * will be returned in the array pointed to by `plan`. `plan_length` should point to the length
